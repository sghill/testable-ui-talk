      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        We wanted a <strong>friendly</strong> UI<br />
        that we could change with <strong>confidence</strong>
      </p>

      <h2>Our Options</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Selenium, Webdriver on a real browser (slow)</li>
        <li>Manually checking interactions (error-prone)</li>
        <li>Headless, browser emulators like envjs and htmlunit (not quite the real thing)</li>
        <li>Headless browsers like phantomjs (interesting)</li>
        <li>Decoupling from the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> and using the MVVM pattern (interesting)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>We Brought in KnockoutJS -- here are the pros</h2>
      <p>
        It's implementation of the MVVM pattern meant we could just right plain ol' javascript objects, which are easy to unit-test
        and don't require testing the integration with the DOM. Knockout's job is binding to the dom, which we could visually verify 
        was working correctly.
      </p>
      <p>It also meant we could use Mozilla's JS Engine Rhino for testing, since we were free of the DOM</p>

      <h2>But How?</h2>
      <p>
        Let's build a login form. We want to help our users out by not letting them click the button until both a username and password
        are present

      <h2>What's the catch?</h2>
      <p>If SEO is a concern, this approach is going to require some extra work. Google recommends having a headless browser to render your stuff
        serverside, and send the googlebot the page (grab link).</p>
